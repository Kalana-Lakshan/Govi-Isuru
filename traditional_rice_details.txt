1) Samba Rice
Description:
- Short, ovular grain with a slightly plump shape. Popular for daily meals and special dishes. Occurs in both white and red-seeded forms. Many local landraces are aromatic and have good cooking quality, often slightly sticky when cooked.

Common diseases & pests:
- Rice blast (Magnaporthe oryzae)
- Bacterial leaf blight (Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae)
- Sheath blight (Rhizoctonia solani)
- Brown spot (Bipolaris oryzae)
- Brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens) and associated virus or hopperburn
- Stem borers and rice hispa

Prevention & management:
- Use certified, disease-resistant Samba cultivars where available.
- Practice crop rotation and field sanitation (remove volunteer rice, stubble burning or incorporation as local practice allows).
- Maintain proper plant spacing and avoid excessive nitrogen which increases susceptibility to blast and planthoppers.
- Seed treatment with approved fungicide and insecticidal seed dressings reduces early infections.
- Timely scouting; apply fungicides or insecticides only when economic thresholds are met (follow local DOA guidance).
- Balanced irrigation management—avoid prolonged leaf wetness when blast risk is high.

Nutrition & fertilization (general guidance):
- Conduct soil test to set targets. For typical smallholder Samba: aim for balanced N-P-K with attention to organic matter.
- Basal: Apply full P and K according to soil test at or before transplanting/sowing; incorporate organic matter (compost) where possible.
- Nitrogen split: Common schedule — 1/3 basal at planting, 1/3 at active tillering (20–30 days after transplanting), 1/3 at panicle initiation (just before heading). Adjust rates to yield target (e.g., total N 60–120 kg/ha depending on soil fertility and desired yield).
- Micronutrients: Apply zinc if deficiency suspected (ZnSO4 at planting) and ensure sulphur and boron levels are adequate for panicle health.

Harvesting & post-harvest:
- Harvest when ~85–90% of grains on the main tillers are firm and straw has started to yellow; typical grain moisture at cutting ~20–24%.
- Cut and thresh promptly; dry grain to safe storage moisture (12–14%) to avoid spoilage.
- For best quality, avoid shattering by harvesting before overmaturity; red-seeded traditional Sambas may require gentler handling to preserve bran color.


2) Kekulu Rice
Description:
- Term `Kekulu` broadly refers to small to medium-grained traditional varieties similar in some ways to Nadu; often consumed as daily white or red rice. May be non-parboiled and has a tender texture when cooked.

Common diseases & pests:
- Similar to general rice: blast, bacterial leaf blight, sheath blight, brown spot, stem borer, planthoppers.

Prevention & management:
- Use clean seed; practice crop/habitat hygiene.
- Avoid dense planting; follow recommended seed rates.
- Integrated pest management: natural enemies, pheromone traps for borers, and selective insecticides as needed.

Nutrition & fertilization:
- Follow soil-test recommendations. Traditional Kekulu types respond well to organic amendments.
- Typical N split: 1/3 basal, 1/3 at tillering, 1/3 at panicle initiation.
- Apply phosphorus at planting to promote root establishment; potassium to support grain filling.

Harvesting & post-harvest:
- Harvest when grains mature but before significant shattering; drying to 12–14% moisture for storage.
- For non-parboiled Kekulu, careful drying and storage prevents rancidity of the bran.


3) Keeri Samba / Supiri Samba
Description:
- Keeri Samba (often called Keeri Samba or Supiri Samba) is a premium small-grain aromatic rice valued for its flavor and distinct texture. Grains are small, somewhat ovate, and often used in special dishes and traditional preparations.

Common diseases & pests:
- Same disease spectrum: blast, sheath blight, bacterial blight, brown spot; aromatic landraces can be more susceptible to lodging if overfertilized.
- Insect pests: stem borers, leaf folders, planthoppers.

Prevention & management:
- Grow in well-drained, fertile soils but avoid excessive N to preserve aroma and reduce lodging and pest attraction.
- Prefer gap-filling rather than heavy reseeding to maintain plant health.
- Use IPM: pheromone traps, biological controls, and spot treatments rather than broad sprays to protect beneficials that maintain aroma quality.

Nutrition & fertilization:
- Lower to moderate nitrogen rates often produce best cooking quality and aroma; example split N at lower end of recommended range (60–80 kg N/ha) unless soil is poor.
- Ensure phosphorus for root development and potassium for grain quality.
- Topdress N at tillering and panicle initiation; avoid late excessive N after heading (can reduce grain quality).

Harvesting & post-harvest:
- For aromatic varieties, harvest at physiological maturity (grain hard, panicle slightly drooping) to maximize aroma and reduce losses.
- Dry carefully at low temperatures and avoid overheating during parboiling or drying to preserve aroma compounds.


4) Suwandel / Suwandal
Description:
- Suwandel (also spelled Suwandal or Suwandel) is a fragrant, traditional Sri Lankan rice often used in festive and ceremonial dishes. It is prized for aroma and slightly distinct taste/texture compared with common varieties.

Common diseases & pests:
- Vulnerable to the usual rice diseases: blast, sheath blight, brown spot, bacterial blight, and insect pests like planthoppers and borers.

Prevention & management:
- Use certified or locally adapted Suwandel seed; stagger plantings to avoid peak pest pressure.
- Maintain field hygiene and use appropriate resistant varieties if available.
- Rotational legumes and green-manure crops reduce disease carryover and improve soil nitrogen.

Nutrition & fertilization:
- Suwandel benefits from balanced nutrition. Maintain good soil organic matter for aroma expression.
- Typical N schedule: split application (basal, tillering, panicle initiation); avoid late N.
- Apply K for grain filling; consider foliar micro-nutrients when deficiency symptoms appear.

Harvesting & post-harvest:
- Harvest at physiological maturity; dry to safe moisture quickly to retain aroma.
- Careful threshing and minimal grain damage preserve market value.


5) Nadu Rice
Description:
- Nadu is a medium-grain rice type widely grown and consumed in Sri Lanka. It often refers to grain size/shape rather than a single cultivar group; available in white and red variants and used for daily meals.

Common diseases & pests:
- Rice blast, sheath blight, bacterial leaf blight, brown spot, tungro virus (transmitted by leafhoppers), planthoppers, stem borers.

Prevention & management:
- Use recommended varieties and certified seed.
- Control vector populations (leafhoppers) to reduce tungro risk — maintain healthy, vigorous plants and consider insecticidal seed treatment.
- Balanced fertilization and appropriate water management reduce disease incidence.

Nutrition & fertilization:
- Nadu is responsive to N but excessive N increases disease and pest risks.
- Standard split N program: basal, tillering, panicle initiation — adjust total N to soil fertility and yield goal (often 60–120 kg N/ha range as an example).
- Phosphorus at planting, potassium in early/mid-season for grain filling.

Harvesting & post-harvest:
- Harvest when grains on main tillers are mature (85–90% grain maturity), typically indicated by firm grains and yellowing straw.
- Thresh and dry to 12–14% moisture for storage; reduce field losses by timely harvesting to prevent shattering and bird/pest damage.


General Best Practices (applies to all traditional varieties):
- Seed selection: Use clean, certified seed when available. Clean seed reduces disease carryover and improves stand uniformity.
- Land prep & planting: Ensure good seedbed and leveled fields for uniform irrigation. Follow recommended seed rates and planting spacing to reduce disease microclimates.
- Water management: Alternate wetting and drying or maintain recommended water depth depending on local recommendations; avoid prolonged leaf wetness when fungal diseases are prevalent.
- Integrated Pest Management (IPM): Combine cultural controls (rotation, sanitation), biologicals (natural enemies), and targeted chemical interventions only as needed.
- Fertility: Perform soil tests. Use organic matter (compost, green manure) to improve soil health and micronutrient availability. Base fertilizer programs on soil-test results; follow split N applications timed to tillering and panicle initiation.
- Harvest timing: Harvest at physiological maturity to balance yield and quality; drying to safe moisture quickly is essential to preserve grain quality and prevent pests/molds.
- Storage: Store dry grain at 12–14% moisture in cool, dry conditions; protect against insects and rodents with cleanliness and sealed containers or appropriate storage structures.

How these codes relate to the earlier sections:
- Codes beginning with `Bg`, `At`, `Bw`, `Ld`, `H`, `MI` are released or tested breeding lines and recommended varieties; many correspond to high-yield modern varieties or improved lines. Traditional types like `Samba`, `Kekulu`, `Nadu`, `Keeri Samba`, and `Suwandel` are landrace/traditional categories discussed earlier and may not map one-to-one to these codes.
- Use the above codes to look up official release information (maturity days, yield potential, recommended fertilizer rates, and disease resistance) from the Department of Agriculture or variety release bulletins.
